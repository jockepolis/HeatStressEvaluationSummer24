# Evaluating Resilience to Heat Stress among Dairy Cows in Sweden üêÑüå°Ô∏è - Summer of 2024

**This GitHub repository houses the codebase for a study investigating the impact of Swedish weather conditions, particularly heat, on dairy cows' milk production on Swedish farms. Using weather data sourced from Sveriges meteorologiska och hydrologiska institut (SMHI) and extensive dairy data from the Gigacow project at Sveriges lantbruksuniversitet (SLU).**

## Introduction

This project studies the relationship between weather conditions and dairy cow milk production in Swedish farms. The motivation stems from the critical importance of understanding how varying temperatures, specifically heat, influence this aspect of agriculture. By combining data from weather and dairy sources, the study employs a diverse set of mathematical and machine learning techniques. These methods, ranging from normalization techniques to modeling and statistical frameworks, enables a exploration of the dynamics. This GitHub repository serves as a hub for the codebase, providing a foundation for future studies. The report, made by Axel Englund & Joakim Svensson made the winter of 2023/2024 can be found [HERE](https://github.com/jockepolis/HeatStressEvaluation/tree/5ecdee8946b3b22e76e41ee09d8631f3338f92ee/Report/HeatStressEvaluation.pdf).
